            <p>South Asia, home to more than one-fourth of the worldâ€™s population, is set to be one of the hardest-hit regions in the world by COVID-19, as the region endures prolonged lockdowns. The economic impact here is likely to be greater than the health impact, as countries in the region do not have the fiscal space or safety nets for flattening the curve by halting production and economic activity.</p>
            <p>To facilitate a conversation on the adaptation that will be required to address the current crisis, Bangladesh Youth Leadership Center (BYLC) is organizing the South Asia Youth Resilience Summit 2020, between April 16 to 18, to be hosted live on Facebook. On each of the three days, there will be a moderated conversation with a global expert for an hour on how young people in South Asia can build resilience and navigate the complexities of present times caused by COVID-19. In addition, there will be workshops and panel discussions on each of the three days on issues ranging from mental health, leadership, to entrepreneurial realities during a global pandemic.</p>
